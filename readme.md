# `caut-rust-ref`

`caut-rust-ref` is an implementation of [Cauterize](https://github.com/cauterize-tools/cauterize) for the Rust programming language.

This repository contains two different projects:

1. `caut-rust-ref`: an executable (written in Haskell) for generating Rust types and [de]serializers from a Cauterize schema.
2. `cauterize`: a Rust crate (library) that defines Cauterize traits and provides [de]serializers for primitive types.
